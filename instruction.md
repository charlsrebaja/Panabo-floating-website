Create a fully responsive and visually appealing tourism website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only, dedicated to the Floating Beach in Panabo City.

Website Title: Floating Beach Panabo City

The design should have a tropical beach theme — use shades of blue, teal, and white, with smooth scroll animations and soft hover effects.

The website must include the following sections:

Navigation Bar — links to Home, About, Gallery, Activities, Location, and Contact. Sticky on scroll.

Hero Section — full-width background image or video of the Floating Beach with an overlay, a big title (“Discover the Floating Beach of Panabo City”), and a “Plan Your Visit” button that scrolls to Contact.

About Section — short history and description of the Floating Beach, its location in Panabo City, and why it’s unique. Include text and an image side by side.

Gallery Section — grid of beautiful beach photos with lightbox or modal view when clicked.

Activities Section — icons or cards listing things to do (swimming, floating cottages, kayaking, food stalls, sunsets, etc.).

Location Section — embedded Google Map showing Floating Beach, with address and how to get there from Davao City.

Contact Section — contact form with fields (Name, Email, Message) and a “Send” button. The form should use basic JavaScript validation (no backend needed). Include links to social media.

Other requirements:

Make the layout mobile-friendly (responsive).

Use smooth scroll navigation.

Add subtle fade-in animations when scrolling.

Include a footer with copyright and credits (“© 2025 Floating Beach Panabo City”).

Use clean, modern fonts like Poppins or Montserrat.

Keep the code clean, commented, and beginner-friendly — all in three files: index.html, style.css, and script.js.
